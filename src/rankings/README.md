# Sendou.ink Tournament Rankings

This module provides comprehensive tournament ranking capabilities for Sendou.ink data.

Key engines:
- **ExposureLogOddsEngine (Recommended)**: log-odds PageRank on mirrored graphs that removes volume bias ("grinding") and focuses on conversion quality.
- **RatingEngine (Core)**: tick-tock PageRank with tournament strength modeling.

## Current Status (v0.2.0)

### Recent Updates
- **Bradley-Terry Probability Model**: Implemented natural probability model `P(A beats B) = s_A / (s_A + s_B)` replacing legacy logistic model
- **Improved Alpha Bounds**: Updated from extreme values (1e3-1e5) to reasonable range (0.1-5.0)
- **Enhanced Evaluation Suite**: 7 orthogonal metrics including discrimination, calibration, ranking order, confidence performance, and stability indicators

### Known Issues & In-Progress Improvements
Based on test_tour_7.ipynb analysis, the current loss function needs improvements:
1. **Poor Calibration**: Low accuracy (~10%) and poor upset O/E ratio (~0.2) indicate probability calibration issues
2. **Unknown Player Handling**: Current approach injects 0.0 ratings for unknown players, causing extreme probabilities
3. **Incomplete Roster Handling**: Teams with many unrated players skew predictions
4. **Loss Function Optimization**: Need better weighting scheme and aggregation methods

### Planned Fixes (from plan.md)
- Implement global prior for unknown players (5th percentile of ratings)
- Add row-skipping rule for teams with â‰¥2 unrated players
- Switch to log-centered aggregation for team ratings
- Implement entropy-weighted loss as primary objective
- Add bye/forfeit match filtering
- Improve teleport vector defaults

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Tournament Data Parsing**: Parse Sendou.ink JSON exports into structured DataFrames
- **Team & Player Rankings**: Rank both teams and individual players
- **Time Decay**: Exponential decay weighting for match age
- **Tournament Strength**: Dynamic tournament importance calculation
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Basic PageRank and advanced tick-tock algorithm

### Algorithms

#### 1. Basic PageRank (`basic_rankings.py`)
- Straightforward PageRank implementation
- Optional tournament strength weighting based on participant count
- Fast and simple for most use cases

#### 2. Exposure Log-Odds Engine (`analysis/engine/exposure_logodds.py`)
- Removes volume bias by computing separate win/loss PageRanks with the same exposure-based teleport, then taking smoothed log-ratios
- Optional surprisal weighting to reward upsets
- Time decay and tournament strength weighting via inherited parameters
- Outputs win PR, loss PR, exposure, and log-odds score

#### 3. Advanced Rating Engine (`analysis/engine/core.py`)
- Tick-tock algorithm that iteratively refines ratings and tournament strengths
- Tournament influence calculated based on participant skill levels
- Multiple aggregation methods for tournament strength
- Configurable teleport vectors and decay models

## Quick Start

```python
import json
from rankings import parse_tournaments_data
from rankings.analysis.engine.exposure_logodds import ExposureLogOddsEngine

# Load and parse tournament data
with open("tournament_data.json") as f:
    raw_data = json.load(f)

tables = parse_tournaments_data(raw_data)
matches_df = tables["matches"]
players_df = tables["players"]

# Recommended: Exposure Log-Odds player rankings (volume-bias free)
engine = ExposureLogOddsEngine(beta=1.0)
rankings = engine.rank_players(matches_df, players_df)

# Optionally post-process (min tournaments, grades, display score)
final = engine.post_process_rankings(
    rankings,
    players_df,
    min_tournaments=3,
)

# Access tournament influence/strength computed during initialization run
tournament_influence = engine.tournament_influence
tournament_strength = engine.tournament_strength

# Core alternative: tick-tock engine
# from rankings import RatingEngine
# engine = RatingEngine(beta=1.0, influence_agg_method="top_20_sum")
# rankings = engine.rank_players(matches_df, players_df)
```

### Core Engine (Alternative)

#### `class RatingEngine`

## Configuration

### Time Decay
Control how much recent matches matter vs historical ones:
```python
# Recent matches matter more (shorter half-life)
engine = RatingEngine(decay_half_life_days=15.0)

# Historical matches remain relevant longer
engine = RatingEngine(decay_half_life_days=60.0)
```

### Tournament Strength
Control how much tournament "strength" affects ratings:
```python
# No tournament strength weighting
engine = RatingEngine(beta=0.0)

# Moderate tournament strength weighting  
engine = RatingEngine(beta=0.5)

# Full tournament strength weighting
engine = RatingEngine(beta=1.0)
```

### Influence Aggregation
How to compute tournament strength from participant ratings:
```python
# Mean skill of all participants
engine = RatingEngine(influence_agg_method="mean")

# Sum of top 20 participant ratings
engine = RatingEngine(influence_agg_method="top_20_sum")
```

## Algorithm Details

### Basic Algorithm
1. Build weighted directed graph from match results
2. Apply exponential time decay to edge weights
3. Optionally weight by tournament strength (based on team count)
4. Run PageRank to get final rankings

### Advanced Algorithm (Tick-Tock)
1. **Initialize**: Set all tournament strengths to 1.0
2. **Tick**: Compute player/team ratings using current tournament strengths
3. **Tock**: Recompute tournament strengths based on participant skill levels
4. **Repeat**: Until tournament strengths converge
5. **Output**: Final ratings and retrospective tournament strength metrics

The tick-tock algorithm produces mutually consistent ratings where strong tournaments are those with strong participants, and strong participants are those who perform well in strong tournaments.

## Performance Notes
